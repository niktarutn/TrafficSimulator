# Project plan feedback
* Solid plan, you've already given quite detailed thought for the implementation!
* Program structure looks good, although more attention should be given to the Qt GUI implementation in the final
  documentation.
* The work division and timeline are both well thought out.
* Have you planned to use any tools to distribute and follow the progress on smaller work packages and tasks?
* I would suggest incorporating testing into the development activities from the first weeks onwards. This is a good way
  to ensure the production of high quality code during the project and often simplifies the final 'qualification
  testing'. Concepts like testing pyramid and TDD are good ones to get familiar.
